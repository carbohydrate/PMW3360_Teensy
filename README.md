# PMW3360_Teensy
PixArt PMW3360 with Teensy

## About
- PMW3360 from here: https://www.tindie.com/products/jkicklighter/pmw3360-motion-sensor/
- Teensy LC: https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html
- Other example code from: https://github.com/SunjunKim/PMW3360_Arduino
- This was almost working with the Teensy LC board that I have, but I ran into some issues, but do not remember what they were anymore.  I think it might have had something to do with the included AdvMouse library.  Maybe some issues with the way SPI was done?

## Other
- Uses Bounce2 library: https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2
